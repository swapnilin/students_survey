# Project Overview: Data Science Career Confidence and Job Preparedness

## Scenario
You are working with a client, a data science training company, that aims to understand what factors contribute to their students' confidence in pursuing a data science career and what preparations are necessary for securing a job in the field. They have recently conducted a survey to gather data on students' learning habits, career aspirations, and confidence levels regarding their skills and job readiness.

### Client's Insights Needs
The client is looking to gain insights into:
1. **Skill Development**: Which skills or experiences are most valued by students and help build their confidence in a data science career?
2. **Learning Resources**: How do students utilize learning platforms, and what resources do they find most beneficial?
3. **Career Readiness Activities**: What activities do students engage in to prepare for a data science job, such as workshops or networking events?
4. **Confidence Levels**: How do students rate their confidence in securing a data science position immediately after completing their training?

Your analysis will help the client tailor their programs and resources to better support students in developing the necessary skills and confidence to succeed in the data science job market.

## Team 2: Data Engineering
### Instructions
- **Data Preparation**: Clean the raw Excel data by renaming columns according to the established definitions relevant to skill development and job preparedness.
- **Database Schema Design**: Design a SQL Server table structure to capture the cleaned data, focusing on normalization and data integrity.
- **Data Loading**: Write SQL scripts to create the database table and load the cleaned data into SQL Server.
- **Data Validation**: Implement validation checks to ensure that the data loaded accurately reflects the responses and meets quality standards.
- **Deliverable**: Submit SQL scripts for table creation and data loading, along with documentation detailing the data cleaning process.
