# Project Overview: Data Science Career Confidence and Job Preparedness

## Scenario
You are working with a client, a data science training company, that aims to understand what factors contribute to their students' confidence in pursuing a data science career and what preparations are necessary for securing a job in the field. They have recently conducted a survey to gather data on students' learning habits, career aspirations, and confidence levels regarding their skills and job readiness.

### Client's Insights Needs
The client is looking to gain insights into:
1. **Skill Development**: Which skills or experiences are most valued by students and help build their confidence in a data science career?
2. **Learning Resources**: How do students utilize learning platforms, and what resources do they find most beneficial?
3. **Career Readiness Activities**: What activities do students engage in to prepare for a data science job, such as workshops or networking events?
4. **Confidence Levels**: How do students rate their confidence in securing a data science position immediately after completing their training?

Your analysis will help the client tailor their programs and resources to better support students in developing the necessary skills and confidence to succeed in the data science job market.


## Team 4: User Experience (Dashboard Creation)
### Instructions
- **User Research**: Gather information on how the client wants to visualize insights related to confidence and job preparedness.
- **Dashboard Design**: Design an interactive dashboard that showcases key insights from the analysis in a user-friendly format.
- **Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate tools for creating the dashboard (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries) based on the client's requirements.
- **Implementation**: Build a prototype dashboard using sample data to demonstrate its functionality and design principles.
- **User Testing**: Conduct usability testing with peers to gather feedback on the dashboard's effectiveness and make adjustments as needed.
- **Deliverable**: Submit a prototype of the dashboard along with documentation explaining design choices and feedback from user testing.
